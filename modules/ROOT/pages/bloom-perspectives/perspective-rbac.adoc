:description: This section describes role-based access control for Perspectives and Scenes in Neo4j Bloom.

[[perspective-rbac]]
= Role-based access control for Perspectives and Scenes

label:enterprise-edition[Enterprise Edition]

As mentioned in xref:bloom-perspectives/perspective-storage.adoc[Storage and sharing], when the Bloom server plugin is used, Perspectives are stored in a persistent Neo4j database.
This means that not only can Perspectives and Scenes be shared between users, but also that administrators can control user-access to them.
For a user to be able to create and/or edit a Perspective, they need to have link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/5/access-control/privileges-writes/[`WRITE`] access to the `\_Bloom_Perspective_` label and to the `\_Bloom_Scene_` label to be able to write to a Scene.
Note that `WRITE` access is only needed to these two labels specifically, not the entire database.

Also mentioned in xref:bloom-perspectives/perspective-storage.adoc[Storage and sharing], is creating custom roles for users which allows administrators to be more explicit with access control.

Remember that all roles with Bloom access need to be authorized in the `neo4j.conf` file, using the `neo4j.bloom.authorization.role`(with Neo4j 4.x) or `dbms.bloom.authorization_role` (with Neo4j 5).
See step 5 in xref:bloom-installation/installation-activation.adoc#installing-server-plugin[Installing server plugin] for more information.

[NOTE]
====
Even more fine-grained access control is also possible, where administrators can control access down to _which property_ a user can access/edit.
Access control, including role management, is described in detail in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/manage-privileges/[Operations Manual -> RBAC and fine-grained privileges] section.
====

In addition to `WRITE` access to `\_Bloom_Perspective_` and the `\_Bloom_Scene_` labels, a role can be further refined with the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/5/access-control/privileges-writes/#access-control-privileges-writes-create[`CREATE`] and the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/5/access-control/privileges-writes/#access-control-privileges-writes-set-property[`SET PROPERTY`] privileges.
By explicitly granting these, instead of a more universal `WRITE`, administrators can limit access to just creating new nodes and/or update properties in a Perspective or a Scene.
See the example further on for an example on how to create a custom role with limited access.

If a user lacks appropriate access, applicable functionality is hidden in Bloom.
For example, if a user has not been granted `WRITE` access to a Perspective, they are not able to see the _Create_ option in the Perspective gallery, they are not able to edit _saved Cypher_, and they are excluded from any modifications of the Perspective.
Accordingly, if a user has not been granted `WRITE` access to a Scene, they are not able to see the _Add new Scene_ option in the Scene drawer.

If a user lacks `WRITE` access to Scenes, their access is restricted to a _Temporary Scene_.
This allows for styling and editing of the Scene, but the changes can't be saved and the Scene is lost at the end of the session.

.Example role

Below is an example of how to create a role, `custom`, with `READ` access.
Users with this role can use a Scene fully, without having `WRITE` access.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE ROLE custom AS COPY OF reader
GRANT CREATE ON GRAPH `neo4j` NODE _Bloom_Scene_ TO `custom`
GRANT CREATE ON GRAPH `neo4j` RELATIONSHIP _Bloom_HAS_SCENE_ TO `custom`
GRANT SET PROPERTY {*} ON GRAPH `neo4j` NODE _Bloom_Scene_ TO `custom`
GRANT DELETE ON GRAPH `neo4j` NODE _Bloom_Scene_ TO `custom`
GRANT DELETE ON GRAPH `neo4j` RELATIONSHIP _Bloom_HAS_SCENE_ TO `custom`

== Perspective actions by database privileges

The following table maps various Perspective actions available to a user according to the database privileges granted to them.
Note that this table is applicable for the Bloom plugin setup only, when storage is provided by the plugin and Perspectives may be shared across users.
For setups without the plugin, Perspectives are stored locally on the user's machine and thus the user can perform all relevant actions.
